# App4Refs

https://app4refs.org/

The objective of the project is to develop an application to support social participation,
inclusion and integration of refugees, and the way to achieve this is by handing them free
and useful tools for field-detected needs through a cell phone app. There are three main
areas the app will turn around: legal information, useful local resources location and
community interaction. Due to technical and financial reasons, the scope of the project
will be reduced to the metropolitan area of Athens in first place, but never discarding to
progressively extend its use to a wider scope, eventually reaching the whole Europe.
The smart phones have a crucial importance for refugees and they are, in fact, one
of their most precious possessions, not only because they allow them to keep in contact
with their acquaintances in their origin countries, but also because they are the most
powerful tool to move around in an unknown, unfamiliar country. App4Refs has the
intention to exploit this technology they already use in a daily basis to provide them
with the information they need to manage in their situation, allowing them to feel more
empowered and increasing their security and the security of those around them.
